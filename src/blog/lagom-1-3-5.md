    Lagom 1.3.5 is ready!

This has been quite a busy month since we released 1.3.4. [Scala Days Copenhagen](http://event.scaladays.org/scaladays-cph-2017) took a lot of time from our schedules and thus 1.3.5 was delayed more than we'd hoped for.

This release is a bugfix release with a couple of community contributions. We're seeing a constant flow of community contributions in the past few releases and that is great news! Special thanks to [crfeliz](https://github.com/crfeliz), [guizmaii](https://github.com/guizmaii), [edouardKaiser](https://github.com/edouardKaiser) and [jaiew](https://github.com/jaiew) for their great work.

## Updating

To update an sbt project, change the version of `lagom-sbt-plugin` in your `project/plugins.sbt` file.

To update a Maven project, change the `lagom.version` property in your top-level `pom.xml`.

## Change log

See the [change log](/changelog-1.3.x.html) for more details on exactly what has been fixed in each release.
