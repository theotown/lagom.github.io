<p>When done right, adopting a reactive microservice architecture can drastically increase a development organization&rsquo;s productivity and velocity. Lagom offers a flexible build approach that supports individual and team development, and that can grow over time. You can put all of your microservices in a single sbt or Maven build (or project), each service can be in a separate build, or multiple builds can contain groups of logically related services. </p>
<p>To choose an approach, consider the pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Single build for multiple services:
    <ul>
      <li>Development of new features often requires simultaneous work on multiple services. Having those services in the same build makes for a frictionless development experience.</li>
      <li>However, as the number of developers working on a build increases, it can slow down velocity if they get in each other&rsquo;s way.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Multiple builds, each with a single service or small group of services:
    <ul>
      <li>Each microservice can be changed independently and move forward faster when isolated. At release time, dependent services can upgrade and use the updated service.</li>
      <li>However, multiple builds add complexity. You need to publish services to make them available to other services. The implementation needs to import all services on which an individual service depends. <a href="MultipleBuilds.html">Splitting a system into multiple builds</a> describes how to deal with this.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>When starting out, it often makes sense keep all services in the same build. A small team can easily work with one build and avoid the lag time and dependencies that arise when systems are divided into multiple builds. As a system and organization evolves, it can make sense to change your approach. For example, as a system grows in functionality, you can split services into different builds. The same principle applies to the teams working on them. It&rsquo;s important not to be afraid to refactor your builds to keep up with your organizational needs.</p>
